# digiduck
This program compiles Ducky Script into something usable for the Digispark ATTiny 85 chip. Get yourself a $1 USB Rubber Ducky.

Available on pip: pip install digiduck

There is a great deal of functionality beyond standard Ducky Script planned for the future. For instance, currently, the REPEAT command is capable of taking two arguments.
REPEAT 4 50 means repeat the last 4 instructions (with any default delay applied) 50 times. The standard single argument also works.

A quick note: Nested repeats are currently unsupported.
